README: Data Cleaning and Correlation Analysis of the Iris Dataset
Overview
This Python script demonstrates basic data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using the Iris dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning. The main goals of this script are:

Loading the dataset and converting it into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
Cleaning the dataset by removing empty rows (if any) and analyzing missing data.
Adding functionality to calculate and interpret correlations between features.
